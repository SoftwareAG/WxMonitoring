# WxMonitoring
WxMonitoring is a ready-to-use webMethods monitoring solution based on Open Elastic Stack (Elastic Search, Logstash, Filebeat), that provides rules-based log-file analysis and activity monitoring to optimize webMethods operations.

## Overview
If running multiple webMethods productive environments it becomes critical to keep track of exceptions in near-time and leverage operational costs. WxMonitoring is a monitoring solution based on Open Elastic Stack, that provides a independent, centralized monitoring. It samples existing IS log-files and supports queries and aggregations views. Additionally automatized rule based actions allows you to react immediately after an exception occurs. They simply send mails, raise JIRA tickets or invoke a compensating service. Rules can be easily defined on existing los messages. For business users WxMonitoring provides views and reports on current and historical process executions.
